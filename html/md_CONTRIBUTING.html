<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>This project and everyone participating in it is governed by OkapiLib's <a class="el" href="md_code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.</p>
<h2>I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!</h2>
<p>You can get help for questions that can't be answered by <a href="https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/okapi/index.html">OkapiLib's docs</a> by <a href="https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib/issues/new/choose">filing an issue</a>.</p>
<h2>How Can I Contribute?</h2>
<h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>
<p>This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.</p>
<p>Before creating bug reports, please check <a href="#before-submitting-a-bug-report">this list</a> as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please <a href="#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report">include as many details as possible</a>. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Note:</b> If you find a <b>closed</b> issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Before Submitting A Bug Report</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Perform a cursory search</b> to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has <b>and the issue is still open</b>, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?</h4>
<p>Bugs are tracked as <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub issues</a>. Create an issue and provide the following information by filling in the template.</p>
<p>Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use a clear and descriptive title</b> for the issue to identify the problem.</li>
<li><b>Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem</b> in as many details as possible. When listing steps, <b>don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it</b>. For example, if you used a <code>ChassisController</code> to drive the robot forward, don't just explain the arguments, but also explain how the method you are calling is used in your code.</li>
<li><b>Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps</b>. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code">Markdown code blocks</a>.</li>
<li><b>Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps</b> and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.</li>
<li><b>Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.</b></li>
<li><b>If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action</b>, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide more context by answering these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Did the problem start happening recently</b> (e.g. after updating to a new version) or was this always a problem?</li>
<li>If the problem started happening recently, what's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?</li>
<li><b>Can you reliably reproduce the issue?</b> If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Include details about your configuration and environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Which version of OkapiLib and PROS are you using?</b> You can get the version by running <code>pros conduct info-project</code> in your terminal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Suggesting Enhancements</h3>
<p>This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.</p>
<p>Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check <a href="#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion">this list</a> as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please <a href="#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion">include as many details as possible</a>. Fill in the template, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.</p>
<h4>Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Perform a cursory search</b> to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?</h4>
<p>Enhancement suggestions are tracked as <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub issues</a>. Create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use a clear and descriptive title</b> for the issue to identify the suggestion.</li>
<li><b>Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement</b> in as many details as possible.</li>
<li><b>Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps</b>. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code">Markdown code blocks</a>.</li>
<li><b>Explain why this enhancement would be useful</b> to most users.</li>
<li><b>Specify which version of OkapiLib and PROS you're using.</b> You can get the version by running <code>pros conduct info-project</code> in your terminal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your First Code Contribution</h3>
<p>Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these <code>beginner</code> and <code>help-wanted</code> issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Beginner issues][good first issue] - issues which should only require a few lines of code</li>
<li>[Help wanted issues][help wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than <code>beginner</code> issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pull Requests</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fill in <a class="el" href="md_PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.html">the required template</a></li>
<li>Title the pull request [issue number][description]<ul>
<li>For example, <code>Issue #0: Add a readme file</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>End all files with a newline</li>
<li>Follow the <a href="#code-styleguide">style guide</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Styleguides</h2>
<h3>Git Commit Messages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")</li>
<li>Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")</li>
<li>Title the commit message [issue number][message]<ul>
<li>For example, <code>Issue #0: Initial commit adding a readme file</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Place additional information after the first line</li>
</ul>
<h3>Git Branch Naming</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project uses Git flow. If you are not familiar, look here: <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a><ul>
<li>If Git flow looks difficult or confusing, you can download <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a> and it will handle branching/merging for you (<a href="https://support.gitkraken.com/git-workflows-and-extensions/git-flow">tutorial here</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Name a new branch according to its purpose in the format: [issue/bug/feature]/[your initials]/[issue number][description]<ul>
<li>For example, to make a branch to fix Issue #0 about adding a README file, name the branch <code>issue/ABC/#0_add_readme_file</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Styleguide</h3>
<h4>clang-format</h4>
<p>OkapiLib uses the program <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html">clang-format</a> to format code to meet a specific style (lightly modified LLVM style). Install the latest version and run <code>./run_clang-format.sh</code> to format all project files. Atom and VS Code, among other editors, have plugins that add support for running clang-format when you save a file. OkapiLib recommends these plugins so you stay on top of your formatting as you work.</p>
<h4>cppcheck</h4>
<p>OkapiLib uses the program <a href="http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/">cppcheck</a> for static analysis. Install the latest version and run <code>./run_cppcheck.sh</code> to check all project files.</p>
<h3>Other Points</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every file must include the MPL2.0 header and attributions to applicable authors (first authors placed first).</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_documentation.htm">Javadoc-style</a> comments on constructors and methods.</li>
<li>Name classes and methods using Camel case. Class names should start with a capital letter.</li>
<li>Do not prefix member variables with <code>m_</code>; instead, prefix parameters with <code>i</code>.</li>
<li>Place protected and private class members at the bottom of the class declaration.</li>
<li>Do not <code>using namespace std</code> or any other namespace as this pollutes the user's namespace.</li>
<li>No raw pointers. Use references (preferably <code>const</code> references) instead. If you need to pass an abstract class and can't use a reference, use a smart pointer.</li>
<li>Use in-class member initializers and default constructors for no-arg constructors where possible.</li>
<li>Use default arguments instead of method overloading.</li>
<li>Everything that can be <code>const</code> should be.</li>
<li>Don't optimize for no reason or prematurely optimize.</li>
</ul>
