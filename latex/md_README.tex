\section*{Okapi\+Lib}

A P\+R\+OS library for programming V\+EX V5 robots. This library is intended to raise the floor for teams with all levels of experience. New teams should have an easier time getting their robot up and running, and veteran teams should find that Okapi\+Lib doesn\textquotesingle{}t get in the way or place any limits on functionality.

Documentation is hosted on the P\+R\+OS website\+: \href{https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/okapi/index.html}{\texttt{ Okapi\+Lib Docs}}

\subsection*{Installing}

Okapi\+Lib is installed by default in new projects. If it is not, you can install it using the P\+R\+OS C\+LI. In your terminal, inside the project you want to install Okapi\+Lib in, run {\ttfamily prosv5 conduct apply okapilib}.
