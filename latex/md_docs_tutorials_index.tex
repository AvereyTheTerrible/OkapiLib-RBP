Learning a new coding platform is often a rather daunting task. For this reason we prepared some small tutorials with examples on how to interact with core components of Okapi\+Lib on your V\+EX V5 system.

The Okapi\+Lib tutorials are split into two sections\+:

\subsection*{Walkthrough Tutorials}

If you want to write full sample programs to learn to use Okapi\+Lib through practical applications, or teach students to use Okapi\+Lib in a classroom environment, the {\bfseries{Walkthrough Tutorials}} are a great resource to go step by step through the process of writing an Okapi\+Lib program.

\subsection*{Topical Tutorials}

If you want more information about using a particular part of the Okapi\+Lib A\+PI after reading through the A\+PI reference, the {\bfseries{Topical Tutorials}} offer longer examples and more detail about using the A\+PI.
